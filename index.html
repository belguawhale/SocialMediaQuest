        <h1>Social Media Quest</h1>
        <p>You are a cutting-edge social media company. Can you make it big?</p>
        <p>Employee time represents time spent on things such as advertising the service, or building new features.</p>
        <p>After monetization is enabled, there are three categories of upgrades: Advertising, Platform, and Partners.</p>
        <p>Upgrades under Advertising increase revenue generated from user data.</p>
        <p>Upgrades under Platform are split into two paths. One increases amount of user data generated from users,
            and one increases amount of revenue generated from users without infringing on privacy.</p>
        <p>Upgrades under Partners increase a combination of users, user data, and revenue generated from such data.</p>
