        <h1>Social Media Quest</h1>
        <p>You are a cutting-edge social media company. Can you make it big?</p>
        <p>There are two main ways to play the game, ethically and unethically. The ethical path derives most of its income
            from user donations (similar to Wikipedia), while the unethical path derives most of its income from exploiting user data.</p>
        <h2>Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Employee time represents time spent on things such as advertising the service, or building new features.
            You can increase the employee time cap and regeneration rate by recruiting or hiring more employees.
        </p>
        <p>Servers represent computing power available. Purchasing servers increases the maximum users and data your site can support.</p>
        <p>After features are enabled, there are three categories of upgrades: Advertising, Platform, and Partners.</p>
        <p>Upgrades under Advertising increase revenue generated from user data.</p>
        <p>Upgrades under Platform are split into two paths. One increases amount of user data generated from users,
            and one increases amount of revenue generated from users without infringing on privacy.</p>
        <p>Upgrades under Partners increase a combination of users, user data, and revenue generated from such data.</p>
